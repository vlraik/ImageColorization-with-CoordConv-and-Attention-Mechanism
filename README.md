# ImageColorization-with-CoordConv-and-Attention-Mechanism
In this repository, I have the source code of my project where I got results comparable (and better on some images) to the SOTA for image colorization using CoordConv and Attention Mechanism

I'll add my trained weights file soon and also upload the link to the dataset.
